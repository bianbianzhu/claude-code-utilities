# Example Collection Template (Phase 0)

Use this template to gather examples before designing a skill.

## Skill Concept

**Working Name:** [skill-name]
**Problem Domain:** [What problem does this skill solve?]

---

## Collected Examples

### Example 1: [Scenario Name]

**Context:** [When would someone use this?]

**Input/Query:**
```
[Exact input the user would provide]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[What the ideal response should look like]
```

**Key Elements:**
- [ ] [Critical element that must be present]
- [ ] [Another required element]

### Example 2: [Scenario Name]

**Context:** [When would someone use this?]

**Input/Query:**
```
[Exact input the user would provide]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[What the ideal response should look like]
```

**Key Elements:**
- [ ] [Critical element that must be present]
- [ ] [Another required element]

## Pattern Analysis

### Common Elements
List patterns you notice across examples:
1. [Pattern 1]
2. [Pattern 2]
3. [Pattern 3]

### Variations
Note where examples differ:
1. [Variation 1]
2. [Variation 2]

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. [Edge case 1]
2. [Edge case 2]

## Baseline Test (Without Skill)

Run these examples through Claude without a skill to establish baseline behavior.

| Example | Baseline Quality (1-5) | Missing Elements | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete at least 3-5 examples
- [ ] Run baseline tests
- [ ] Identify gaps between baseline and desired output
- [ ] Proceed to Gap Analysis (Phase 1)
