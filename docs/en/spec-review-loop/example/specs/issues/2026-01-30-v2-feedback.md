## Issue 3: Booking domain contracts missing

- **Suggestion**: Define internal normalized booking contracts (BookingCandidate, BookingSearchQuery, BookingSearchResult, placeholder key inventory) even though the external ROLLER API format is unknown.
- **Decision**: Declined
- **Reasoning**:
  1. **Violates spec purpose**: The Spec Generation Guide core principle states specs are "behavioral contracts, not implementation blueprints." Creating speculative data shapes for an API whose format is explicitly unknown introduces exactly the kind of type drift and stale specs the guide warns against.
  2. **Open Questions is correct**: The spec already acknowledges this gap in Open Questions ("What's the exact format of booking search API response?"). This is the appropriate handling — flag it as unknown, don't invent shapes.
  3. **`map[string, any]` is intentional**: For MVP/SLC, using untyped maps for `parameters` and `response_data` is appropriate when the external contract is TBD. The adapter layer will normalize these shapes once the actual API is known.
  4. **Risk of over-specification**: Pre-defining "normalized" shapes risks:
     - Creating contracts that don't match the actual API, causing drift
     - Over-constraining adapter design before requirements are clear
     - Adding maintenance burden with no implementation value
  5. **G9 compliance**: Centralized contracts (G9) applies to known data shapes that are shared across components. The booking search response is external data that flows through; normalizing it is an implementation concern for the adapter, not a spec-level contract.

  **Alternative approach**: When the ROLLER booking search API format is confirmed, add a minimal normalized contract at that time. Until then, the behavioral contracts (fuzzy search capability, disambiguation behavior) are sufficient for implementation planning.
