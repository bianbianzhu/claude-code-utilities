## Summary

- **Accepted**: 1
- **Declined**: 1
- **Already Resolved**: 2

## Notes

### Issue 1: Multi-plan blocking_prompt ambiguity
The v5 fix added the `Submit Blocking Prompt Answer` interface but left multi-plan routing ambiguous. Added an explicit invariant constraining the system to at most one blocked plan per session, with conflict error if violated.

### Issue 3: Boundary contracts centralization (Declined)
The IQ integration boundary is an external interface defined once in the Service Interface section, not a shared internal data structure referenced by multiple specs. Centralizing it would add complexity without reducing drift risk. The inline definition is appropriate for an external-facing boundary contract.
