## Feedback

### Issue 2 (Partial): HandleBookingUpdateResponse as Discriminated Union

- **Suggestion**: Create a `HandleBookingUpdateResponse` as a discriminated union (plan / clarification / error) in centralized contracts
- **Decision**: Declined
- **Reasoning**: Discriminated unions are a language-specific pattern (TypeScript, Rust) that doesn't translate cleanly to all languages. The response shapes are already clearly defined in the "Inbound: Handle Booking Update Request" behavioral contract with explicit "One of:" semantics. Per SPEC_GENERATION_GUIDE core principle, specs are behavioral contracts — they define what the component does, not how to implement it in a specific type system. The current prose definition is sufficient for implementers to create appropriate types in their target language.

### Issue 3 (Partial): Retry Policy Matrix

- **Suggestion**: Define a retry policy matrix by Error Type specifying allowed/forbidden retry and what qualifies as "self-correction" vs "retry"
- **Decision**: Declined
- **Reasoning**: The existing Error Classification table (Section: Error Classification, lines 183-191) already defines behavior per error type. Adding a separate retry policy matrix would duplicate this information and create drift risk. The self-correction vs auto-retry distinction is now clarified in the behavioral contract text itself, which is the appropriate place for that context.
