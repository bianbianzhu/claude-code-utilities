## Detailed Decisions

### Issue 1: Langfuse PII/token redaction

- **Decision:** Already Resolved
- **Reasoning:** Resolved in v2 feedback review. Existing Langfuse data cleaning pipeline handles redaction; spec-level redaction policy not required.
- **Guide Rule:** G11

### Issue 2: blocking_prompt / waiting for user state

- **Decision:** Already Resolved
- **Reasoning:** Fixed in v2. `blocking_prompt` field added to ExecutionPlan contract; invariants clarify pause semantics; Get Plan Status returns blocking_prompt when set.
- **Guide Rule:** G10

### Issue 3: Booking domain contracts missing

- **Decision:** Declined
- **Reasoning:** The `map[string, any]` typing for `parameters` and `response_data` is intentional flexibility for an integration where the external ROLLER API contract is explicitly TBD (Open Questions). Creating "post-adapter" booking contracts now would be speculative and violate the spec principle of avoiding implementation details for unknown externals. When the ROLLER API shape is confirmed, contracts can be refined during planning phase.
- **Guide Rule:** G9

### Issue 4: External service interface incomplete

- **Decision:** Accepted (partial)
- **Changes Applied:**
  - Updated "Outbound: Status Updates" section to explicitly mark as deferred for MVP
  - Clarified MVP uses polling via "Get Plan Status"
  - Updated README.md deferred items to include push-based status updates
- **Not Applied:** Formal request/response contract tables. The current prose descriptions with references to centralized ExecutionPlan are sufficient for behavioral contracts.
- **Guide Rule:** G8
