### Issue 3: Booking domain contracts are missing

- **Suggestion**: Add BookingSummary, BookingSearchRequest/Response contracts, and canonical placeholder keys to `specs/contracts/data-definitions.md`
- **Decision**: Declined
- **Reasoning**: The booking search API is an external ROLLER API — its shape is determined by ROLLER, not by this spec. The Open Questions section already correctly flags this as unknown ("What's the exact format of booking search API response?"). Defining speculative contracts would either guess at ROLLER's API shape (creating drift risk when actual API differs) or over-specify what ROLLER should return (out of scope for this design). Per SPEC_GENERATION_GUIDE: specs are behavioral contracts for the system being designed, not for external dependencies. The appropriate pattern is to document the dependency and adapt to whatever ROLLER provides during implementation.
