## Summary

| Issue ID | Title | Decision | Changes Applied | Guide Rule |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Missing interface for answering `blocking_prompt` and resuming execution | Already Resolved | None — interface and session invariant already present | G8 |
| 2 | Contradiction between "post-confirmation immutability" and executor "adjust sequence" | Already Resolved | None — clarification distinguishing structural vs parameter-level changes already present | G10 |
| 3 | IQ integration request/response contracts not centralized | Already Resolved (Declined-Accepted) | None — human reviewer confirmed decline is acceptable | G9 |
| 4 | `ExecutionPlan.user_id` required but service interface does not supply it | Already Resolved | None — `user_id` explicitly supplied by IQ and ownership preconditions defined | G8 |

## Detailed Outcomes

### Issue 1: Missing `blocking_prompt` interface

**Decision:** Already Resolved

**Verification:** The spec at `2026-01-29-booking-updates-design.md` contains:
- Complete "Inbound: Submit Blocking Prompt Answer" interface (lines 246-255)
- Session-level invariant: "At most one plan per `session_id` may be in `executing` status with `blocking_prompt` set at any time"

No changes required.

### Issue 2: Contradiction between immutability and executor adjust

**Decision:** Already Resolved

**Verification:** The spec clearly distinguishes:
- Executor "self-correct within the confirmed action sequence: fix parameter formatting, resolve placeholders, retry failed steps" (line 157)
- "Post-confirmation immutability: The confirmed plan's actions/parameters may not be structurally modified post-confirmation (only data gaps filled)" (lines 370-371)

These are consistent — parameter-level corrections are allowed; structural changes are prohibited.

No changes required.

### Issue 3: IQ integration contracts not centralized

**Decision:** Already Resolved (Declined-Accepted)

**Verification:** Per v7 report, human reviewer (highest priority) agreed with the implementer's decline:
- The IQ integration boundary is an external interface defined once (not duplicated across multiple specs)
- Centralizing it adds structure without reducing drift risk

This is compliant with the spirit of G9 — the concern is drift from duplication, which doesn't apply here.

No changes required.

### Issue 4: `user_id` supply issue

**Decision:** Already Resolved

**Verification:** The spec properly addresses this:
- `user_id` is required in `ExecutionPlan` (data-definitions.md line 41)
- Inbound interface explicitly requires `user_id` from IQ: "user_id (string, provided by IQ from authenticated session)" (line 218)
- Ownership preconditions defined for confirm (line 231) and answer (line 249) operations

No changes required.

## Completion Status

All issues from v7 verification are resolved. No spec changes were required — all issues were either previously fixed or appropriately declined with human reviewer confirmation.
