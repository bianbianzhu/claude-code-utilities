## Detailed Decisions

### Issue 1: Get Plan Status Missing AuthZ Context (IDOR Risk)
- **Decision:** Already Resolved
- **Changes Applied:** None - the spec already includes `user_id`, auth token, ownership precondition, and 401/403 error cases in the "Get Plan Status" inbound contract.

### Issue 2: Queue Failure Recovery Contradicts Confirm Plan Idempotency and State Model
- **Decision:** Accepted
- **Changes Applied:** Updated the "LLM Planner → Queue Manager" cross-module interface:
  - Changed "Data passed" from `Execution Plan (status: confirmed)` to `Execution Plan (status: pending_confirmation); status transitions to confirmed only after successful enqueue acknowledgement`
  - Changed "When called" from `After user confirms plan` to `After user confirms plan (enqueue attempt)`
- **Reasoning:** The original wording created ambiguity about whether the payload's status field represented persisted state or intended transition. The fix aligns the cross-module interface with the "Inbound: Confirm Plan" contract which clearly states status only becomes `confirmed` on enqueue success.

### Issue 3: Metadata Overlay Field Name Drift vs Central Contract
- **Decision:** Already Resolved
- **Changes Applied:** None - the spec consistently uses `iq_enabled` which matches the centralized contract.

### Issue 4: Central Contract Type System Is Internally Inconsistent (`time` Undefined)
- **Decision:** Already Resolved
- **Changes Applied:** None - a prior fix already added the canonical `time` primitive type definition (HH:MM 24-hour format) to the contracts.
