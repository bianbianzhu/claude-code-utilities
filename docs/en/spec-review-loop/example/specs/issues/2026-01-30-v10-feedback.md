### Issue 2: HandleBookingUpdateResponse Discriminated Union

- **Suggestion**: Add a centralized `HandleBookingUpdateResponse` contract defining the response envelope as a discriminated union (e.g., `response_kind` enum with optional fields for each response type).
- **Decision**: Declined
- **Reasoning**: The individual payload types are now fully centralized (`ExecutionPlan`, `ServiceError`, clarification string). Specifying a discriminator field structure (e.g., `response_kind`) would prescribe implementation-level choices — whether to use a tagged union, separate response types, or polymorphic handling is a language/framework decision. Per G4, data shapes should remain abstract and language-agnostic. The prose "one of" semantics combined with centralized payload contracts provide sufficient cross-module alignment without over-specifying the envelope structure. This has been reviewed by human reviewer and agreed (high priority).
