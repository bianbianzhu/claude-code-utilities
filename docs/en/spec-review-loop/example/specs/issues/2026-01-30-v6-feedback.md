## Issue 3: IQ integration request/response contracts not centralized

- **Suggestion**: Centralize IQ↔service boundary shapes (`BookingUpdateRequest`, `BookingUpdateResponse`, `ServiceErrorType`) in `specs/contracts/` with abstract union definitions.
- **Decision**: Declined
- **Reasoning**: G9 (Centralized Contracts) prevents type drift when multiple specs define the same data structure. The IQ integration boundary is an external interface defined once in the Service Interface section—it's not referenced or duplicated by other specs. The internal data shapes (`ExecutionPlan`, `ActionResult`, etc.) that are shared across components are already centralized in `specs/contracts/data-definitions.md`. Creating a separate contracts file for an external boundary that exists in one location adds structural complexity without reducing drift risk. The inline behavioral description ("One of: Plan response / Clarification response / Error response") is appropriate for documenting an external API contract, not a shared internal type.
- **Human Review**: Human reviewer (highest priority) has agreed with this decline.
