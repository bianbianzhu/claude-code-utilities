### Issue 3: IQ integration request/response contracts not centralized

- **Suggestion**: Add centralized contracts for the integration boundary including `BookingUpdateRequest`, `BookingUpdateResponse` as discriminated union, and `ServiceErrorType` with mapping rules to action-level errors
- **Decision**: Partially Declined
- **Reasoning**:
  1. The core concern (two different error enums) is valid and was addressed by adding a clarifying note distinguishing service-level vs action-level errors
  2. The full suggested fix (discriminated unions, separate ServiceErrorType enum, mapping rules) would introduce implementation-level detail that violates G1 (No Complete Implementation Code) and G4 (Data Shapes Are Abstract)
  3. Service-level errors are simple boundary conditions (invalid_input / service_unavailable / auth_required) that don't warrant a separate centralized contract structure for MVP
  4. Creating explicit typed union structures would be specifying "how to implement" rather than "what the behavior is" - the discriminator pattern is an implementation choice
  5. The inline definition with clarifying note is sufficient for implementers to understand the boundary without over-engineering the spec
